# file_comparison
This is a little file comparison project I did. I was working with the DDOsecrets Parler data set of posts when I realized it seemed like their files were carbon copies of each other. Thus, I decided I should go ahead and check each of those in turn. I thought I should share my code here in case anyone else runs into a similar problem ever and wants my solution. Sadly, it's very i/o heavy and so it runs incredibly slowly. It's only single core optimized right now, but I'm considering running through some optimization down the line. Further, because I'm only comparing with the first file, it's a bit risky, but since the goal is only to find out if the files are all identical, this is good enough for this.

I started off by checking all of the files, but I quickly realized that a) that is slow, and b) isn't the best way to do this. Thus, I went ahead and made a [second ipynb](https://github.com/kyleashburn/file_comparison/blob/main/Random%20Sampling.ipynb) where I just show how you can take a simple random sample of file names and check those. I used Hamming Distance because that made the most sense here. It's very fast and since it is focused on string edit distance, can tell us if the string of the files are identical.
